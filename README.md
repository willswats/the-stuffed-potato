## General Information

During work experience, a local takeaway restaurant needed a new website, therefore, I was tasked with building an example of what it could look like. It was built within one week and it was the first time that I used Next.js.

## Install

1. Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation).
2. `cd` to this projects' directory.
3. Run `pnpm install` to install the projects' dependencies.
4. Run `pnpm dev` to run the server locally.
